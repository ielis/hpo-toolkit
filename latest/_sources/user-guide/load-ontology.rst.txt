Load ontology
=============

Loading HPO is the first item of all analysis task lists.
HPO toolkit supports loading the ontology data from an `Obographs <https://github.com/geneontology/obographs>`_
JSON file which is available for download from the `HPO website <https://hpo.jax.org/app/data/ontology>`_.

Ontology loaders
****************

HPO toolkit provides 2 ways for loading an ontology: a low-level loader and a high-level :class:`OntologyStore`.

Low level loader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The low-level loader function loads a :class:`hpotk.ontology.MinimalOntology` from a local or remote resource.
The loader will open the resource and parse its contents into an ontology. Any failure is reported as an exception.

Let's load the HPO version released on Oct 9th, 2023:

.. doctest:: load-minimal-ontology

  >>> import hpotk

  >>> url = 'https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/releases/download/v2023-10-09/hp.json'
  >>> hpo = hpotk.load_minimal_ontology(url)
  >>> hpo.version
  '2023-10-09'

We use the :func:`hpotk.ontology.load.obographs.load_minimal_ontology` function to fetch the Obographs JSON file
and to load the data into :class:`hpotk.ontology.MinimalOntology`.

.. note::

  The loader can fetch the HPO from a local path (relative or absolute), or from a URL,
  and it transparently handles decompression of gzipped files if the file name has a `.gz` suffix.

A similar loader function :func:`hpotk.ontology.load.obographs.load_ontology` exists
to load an :class:`hpotk.ontology.Ontology`.


Ontology store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, we can use the :class:`hpotk.util.store.OntologyStore`, a class that wraps the low-level loader
and provides more convenience.

Using `OntologyStore` provides several benefits. `OntologyStore` caches the ontology data files in a local directory
to prevent downloading a HPO release more than once, to save time spent during slow network access.

.. doctest:: load-minimal-ontology

  >>> store = hpotk.configure_ontology_store()
  >>> hpo = store.load_minimal_hpo(release='v2023-10-09')
  >>> hpo.version
  '2023-10-09'

The store will download the ontology file the first time a release (e.g. `v2023-10-09`) is requested, and subsequent
loads will skip the download. The `release` must be a release tag, as defined
in the tag section of the `HPO release page <https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/tags>`_.

Moreover, `OntologyStore` will load the *latest* release, if the `release` option is omitted.

.. doctest:: load-minimal-ontology

  >>> hpo_latest = store.load_minimal_hpo()
  >>> hpo_latest.version  # doctest: +SKIP
  '2024-03-06'

As of the time of this writing, ``2024-03-06`` is the latest HPO release.


The store exposes the path of the ontology resources. For HPO, this is the path to the JSON file:

.. doctest:: load-minimal-ontology

  >>> fpath_hpo = store.resolve_store_path(ontology_type=hpotk.OntologyType.HPO, release='v2023-10-09')
  >>> fpath_hpo  # doctest: +SKIP
  '/path/to/.hpo-toolkit/HP/hp.v2023-10-09.json'

The ontology resources can be cleaned to remove the content of the local directory:

.. doctest:: load-minimal-ontology

  >>> store.clear()  # doctest: +SKIP

Loading an ontology is a prerequisite for doing anything useful with the ontology data. Check out
the :ref:`use-ontology` section for an overview of the functionality.
